#ðŸ“Œ AI Agent for Medical X-ray Diagnosis & Report Generation

ðŸš€ Vision Transformers (ViT) | RAPIDS cuDF/cuCIM | Hugging Face BLIP-2 | Streamlit | PyTorch

ðŸ©º Project Overview
This AI Agent leverages deep learning to analyze chest X-ray images, classify diseases, and generate automated medical reports. It integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) for image analysis, BLIP-2 for AI-generated reports, and RAPIDS cuDF/cuCIM for GPU-accelerated processing.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
âœ” Automated Disease Classification: Uses Vision Transformers (ViT) to predict chest conditions like Cardiomegaly, Atelectasis, Pneumonia, etc.
âœ” AI-Powered Medical Reports: Generates human-like radiology reports using Hugging Face BLIP-2.
âœ” GPU-Accelerated Data Processing: Implements RAPIDS cuDF for structured medical data and cuCIM for high-speed image handling.
âœ” Interactive Streamlit Dashboard: Upload an X-ray, get disease predictions, and receive an AI-generated report in real-time.
